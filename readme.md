# LangChain
LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. We believe that the most powerful and differentiated applications will not only call out to a language model, but will also be:
Data-aware: connect a language model to other sources of data

Agentic: allow a language model to interact with its environment

The LangChain framework is designed around these principles.
This is the Python specific portion of the documentation. For a purely conceptual guide to LangChain, see here. For the JavaScript documentation, see here.
